* Install and update

The scripts are written in [[https://clojure.org][Clojure]] with [[https://babashka.org][Babashka]] and we recommend installing them with [[https://github.com/babashka/bbin][bbin]].

- [[https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure][Install Clojure]]
- [[https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation][Install babashka]]
- [[https://github.com/babashka/bbin#installation][Install bbin]]

This should take care of installing all you need:

: ~$ brew install babashka/brew/bbin

Once =bbin= is installed in your environment, run this in a terminal:

- =bbin install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzg/utils/refs/heads/main/src/subscribe.clj=
